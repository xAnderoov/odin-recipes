      <h3>Bake and Chill Potatoes
      </h3>
      <p>Wrap each potato in foil and place on a baking sheet. Use a knife to poke holes in the potatoes, then bake
        until the potatoes are tender and easily pierced with a fork. Allow the potatoes to cool completely, unwrap, and
        place on a plate. Cover and refrigerate overnight.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Shred Potatoes</h3>
      <p>Use a cheese grater to shred the (skin-on) potatoes into a large bowl. Add shallots, seasonings, and cheese.
        Mix well. Add sour cream and stir until just-combined.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Bake</h3>
      <p>Transfer the potato mixture to a buttered casserole dish. Pat it down lightly. Bake until the potatoes are hot
        and the top is browned.</p>
